# Run simulaton in `quiet` mode

Until now, the geometry has been visualization. Simulations have not yet run. So in order to run simulation of tracks, it is better to run them in quiet mode rather than visualizating and simulating the tracks. In order to run `10000` events of $\pi^{+}$ tracks, run the following command 

# Run simulation in `batch` mode from inside singularity
