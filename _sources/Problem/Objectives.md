# Objectives of the problem

There are mainly 5 objectives. 3 `momentum` objectives in 3 different eta. followed by `CostProxy` for the cylinders and `CostProxy` for the disks.

# The Momentum resolution

Write down the formula for this. And how is this calculated. Qualitatively explain how is this competing with `CostProxies`

# Reconstruction Efficiency

This is also competing with `CostProxies`

# Relation to Statistics

This is basically useful if we want to embed errors on the objectives. Will work out to be interesting.
