# Adaptive experimentation for detector design

With the advent of large scale physics experiments and ever increasing complexity of detector techonlogies, conventional methods struggle to navigate and optimize these multi dimensional design problem. 

In order to more effectively tackle the problem, variety of Multi Objective Optimization (MOO) algorithms have been proposed by the Data Science community over the years. 

This project tries to document and develop Bayesian based methods to effectively optimize the multi dimensional design and objective space using State of the Art tools provided by `Ax-platform`.
