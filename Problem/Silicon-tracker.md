# Silicon wafers as tracker

How does thickness affect scattering. Why is it important to reduce scatering due to material. How costly can the tracker get when it becomes thinner. Also, the pitch is related to the thickness. 

# The Barrel Cylinders

The barrel Cylinders. The stave design. How it is built. Latest efforts from ITS3 ALICE collaboration and IT2 collaboration. Convince that the design parameters' extent used in this exercise is still realistic. 

# The Disk like detectors

How are the disks made from pixels. How many layers are being built. Make sure to include the details of the services as well.

# Why is it super hard to put a price on the construction

Basically, the scaling between the thickness, pitch, is super nonlinear and often very difficult to come up with pricing. A simple Geometric Mean of all the thickness is taken here. 

# What is the goal of this optimization

This optimization certainly allows a few 'unphysical' geometries. It would be great to see if MOBO can also figure out these are 'unphysical' since they will have poor momentum resolution as well as high scattering.

# The Holy Grail configuration

Why is this called holy grail. Since it has to most number of design as well as optimziation parameters. Also, the number of objectives can be easily increased by breaking the objectives in bins of $\eta$ and p.

# The other types of configuration / ideas

This should be thought more
