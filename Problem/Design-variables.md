# Design variables

The exact set of design variables and any other relavant information about it

# List of Constraints

There are a total of 5 constraints that are embededd in the parameterization already. Give a detailed account of all the constraints. Also, reason out why these constraints are put in the first place

# Hard and Soft Constraints

Probably, the most interexting. Explain about the radius of the disks being a integral multiple due to pixel arrangement. Same argument for Radius of cylinder due to stave design. Try to put in some sketches to better explain this.
