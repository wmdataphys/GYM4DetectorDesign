# Problem formulation workflow

The problem starts with building up cylinders followed by building support structures and finally placing in disks. Explain in detail how is this done.

## Logic behind the code base

Why do we have `.setting` file. this is the file used by `C++` macros to set appropriate variables. Also `.config` is the design variables that is suggested by `MOBO`

## Steering files for various settings

Why do we want to have more than one `.setting` file. Idea of generic `GYM` code.
